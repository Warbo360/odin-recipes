This is a basic HTML project that is to be done after learning HTML basics from The Odin Project. It will display my learned skills of HTML, inlcluding use of the HTML boilerplate layout for all HTML projects, various elements like heads, title in heads, body, paragraphs, strong text, emphasized text, links via anchors, images via img, and all of the various attributes associated with those elements. The end goal is making a basic recipe-list webpage. This is to also be done in conjuction with the use of Git and Github to establish a good workflow that can be tracked locally (my own machine) and remotely (GitHub), this to have a projects portfolio and to practice in the use of Git and GitHub.
