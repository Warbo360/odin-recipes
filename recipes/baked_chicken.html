            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of ground tyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of smoked paprika</li>            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Let chicken thaw to room temp</li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 425 Farenheit</li>
            <li>Pat chicken dry with papertowl and place on baking sheet</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in olive oil and then the dry spice rub mix, I find wearing nitrile gloves makes this task easy</li>
            <li>Once oven is up to temp place the tray with the chicken in the oven, this will cook for ~18-20 minutes</li>
            <li>At the 9-10 minute mark flip the breasts and continue cooking</li>
            <li>At the 18 minute mark check the internal temp of the chicken, needs to reach 165 as carry over cooking will take it to ~170, once reached take out of the oven and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>Once rested slice the chicken across its length and enjoy with any and all sides!</li>            
        </ol>
