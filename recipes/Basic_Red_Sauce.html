        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p>This sauce while simple in prep and ingredients given enough time will turn any pasta dish into a classic friends and family will end up loving. This is best served with any pasta that will can cling sauce onto it well, our recommendations being classic spaghetti, penne, or something like a rigatoni. If you can find bronze die-pulled pasta all the better as that gives the pasta a rougher texture which is better for sauce to cling onto.</p>
        <p>While the sauce is basic, you can customize it however suits your needs as well, adding whatever protein you have lying around or topping a protein with the  sauce as well (looking at you chicken parm) is a great way to get additional uses out of this recipe.</p>
